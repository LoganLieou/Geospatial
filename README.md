## Geospatial ðŸª¨

This repository will contain visualizations for geospatial information as well as some learning methods on said data. At the moment all I have is the deployed RMarkdown website, but it looks pretty cool so I decided to deploy it later on I want to do some machine learning with this type of data, but not sure what yet.
